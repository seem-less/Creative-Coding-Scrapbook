A collection of sketches from my creative coding practice in OpenFrameworks.  Each folder contains picture, video samples and source code for building the sketches in OpenFrameworks (v0.10.0).

Some of the sketches seen here have been inspired by the following books:
  "The Nature of Code" - By Daniel Shiffman.
  "ofBook" - [Credits found here](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html)
